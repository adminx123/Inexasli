Phased Plan: Remove Email Storage, Use OAuth User ID for Authenticated Users

---



Phase 1: Preparation & Analysis  ✅ COMPLETE (July 22, 2025)
- All code audited for email storage, lookup, and logging (KV, DB, logs, etc.)
- All user identification logic located (rate limiter, payment, etc.)
- Dependencies and modules interacting with user identity listed

Findings:
- Email is used for user identification in backend/payment logic, especially in:
  - /payment/stage3-test.js, /payment/stage4-test.js, /payment/stage5-test.js, /payment/stage6-test.js, /payment/redirectUrl.html
  - /ai/rate-limiter/rateLimit.js, /ai/rate-limiter/rateLimiter.js
  - /ai/master.js (payload validation, rate limit, payment verification)
- No email is stored in browser localStorage or frontend modules.





Phase 2: Refactor for OAuth User ID  ✅ COMPLETE (July 22, 2025)
- All backend and payment logic now uses OAuth user ID for authenticated users.
- KV/data access patterns updated.
- Fingerprint logic retained for anonymous/free users.


Phase 3: Remove Email Storage & Usage  ✅ COMPLETE (July 22, 2025)
  - All email-based identification logic removed/orphaned in backend and payment modules except for free/recovery flows.
  - All main logic now uses OAuth user ID for authenticated users; fingerprint for anonymous/free users.
  - No email is used as a key or value in any KV, DB, or log except for recovery/free flows.
  - "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with Apple" buttons added to payment modal (paymentform.js), ready for OAuth integration.
  - Ready for Phase 4 (testing).

Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Test all flows (free, paid, upgrade, downgrade, rate limiting) for both anonymous and authenticated users.
- Confirm no email is stored or processed anywhere in the system.
- Validate that OAuth user ID-based logic works for all authenticated features.

Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
- Deploy changes to staging, then production.
- Monitor for errors, regressions, or unexpected behavior.
- Periodically audit to ensure no email data is being stored or processed.
