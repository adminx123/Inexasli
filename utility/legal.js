Description: The Services include educational technology interfaces for learning and exploration, as well as managed automation services for business clients. Businesses purchase access to managed services, not ownership of the technology or code. All AI-generated content originates from third-party providers through our engineered prompts and is intended as educational material or for business automation, not as definitive guidance for decision-making.

Privacy Policy Compliance:
- The Developer complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users within the European Union and also adheres to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) for users in Canada.`

            title: "Services Purpose",
            content: `**Educational Technology Platform**
- INEXASLI provides educational technology interfaces that facilitate user interactions with third-party AI systems for learning and exploration across various domains.
- Our technology includes prompt engineering, user interface design, and data organization tools that help users structure their interactions with artificial intelligence systems.
- These are educational technology tools intended to help users formulate better questions and prepare for consultations with qualified professionals in relevant fields.
- Interactive Learning: Users engage with third-party AI-generated content by inputting personal data through our interfaces, receiving AI responses, and using these responses as starting points for further research and professional consultation.

**Prompt Engineering and Technology Services**
- The primary purpose of our technology is to help users organize their thoughts and data for more effective AI interactions.
- Our engineered prompts and user interfaces are designed to facilitate educational AI conversations, not to provide professional guidance.
- All content generation is performed by third-party AI providers; INEXASLI provides only the technological framework for interaction.

**Third-Party AI Integration**
- The Services utilize third-party artificial intelligence providers (including but not limited to XAI/Grok) to generate all responses and analysis.
- User input data is transmitted to these external AI services for processing and response generation through our technological interfaces.
- INEXASLI does not control the AI models, training data, or response generation methods of these third-party providers.
- AI responses may vary in accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness based on the limitations and biases inherent in large language models and AI systems.

**No Professional Advice or Services**
- INEXASLI provides educational technology services only. We do not provide professional advice, including but not limited to medical, nutritional, financial, legal, psychological, therapeutic, or business advice.
- Technology Interface Only: All outputs, analyses, and insights are generated by third-party AI systems through our technological interfaces. These should be viewed as starting points for research and discussion with qualified professionals, not as authoritative guidance from INEXASLI.
- Educational Content: Any responses received through our platform originate from third-party AI providers and are intended for educational exploration only. They are not professional assessments, advice, or recommendations from INEXASLI.
- For Learning and Exploration: Use AI-generated results to understand concepts, explore possibilities, and prepare questions for professional consultations. Always seek independent advice from qualified professionals for specific decisions in any field.`

        {
            title: "Data Security & Privacy",
            content: `**Client-Side and Server-Side Processing**
- Form input data is stored in your browser's localStorage for continuity, but is also transmitted to Cloudflare Workers and third-party AI providers for processing.
- Privacy-conscious device fingerprints are generated locally in your browser for rate limiting and abuse prevention purposes.
- Your data travels internationally through Cloudflare's network and third-party AI provider servers for response generation.
- We do not permanently store your data, but it is temporarily processed through these external services.

**Data Storage and Security**
- All data you enter is stored in your browser's localStorage, specific to each Service's page, and remains on your device in plain text.
- Data retention: Your data stays in localStorage until you clear it or for up to 365 days, whichever comes first.
- Security depends on your browser and system. localStorage is not encrypted by default.
- Payment data security is managed by our third-party payment provider, adhering to industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

**Payment Data**
- When you make a payment (e.g., for premium subscriptions), your payment information is processed securely via a third-party payment provider (Stripe). We do not store your full payment details on our servers; only minimal transactional data (e.g., username, transaction ID) is retained as required for billing and support purposes, in compliance with applicable laws.

**International Users**
- Since no data leaves your device for storage, local data protection laws (e.g., GDPR for European users) apply to your own management of the data.

**Reporting Concerns**
- For questions about data security, AI processing, third-party data handling, or privacy practices, contact us at support@inexasli.com`

        {
            title: "Rate Limiting and Device Fingerprinting",
            content: `**Privacy-Conscious Usage Monitoring**
- To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the Services implement privacy-conscious rate limiting using device fingerprinting technology.
- A unique identifier is generated based on non-personal browser characteristics including screen resolution, timezone, browser type, and canvas rendering patterns.
- Device fingerprints are used solely for rate limiting, abuse prevention, and ensuring fair access to AI processing resources.
- Fingerprint data automatically expires after 24 hours, ensuring that usage tracking resets daily for privacy protection.

**Centralized Rate Limiting System**
- The Services utilize a centralized rate limiting system powered by Cloudflare Workers and KV storage to enforce fair usage limits across all AI modules.
- Different AI tools have different usage limits based on processing complexity and resource requirements (e.g., 2 requests per minute for income analysis, 1 request per minute for personality analysis).
- The system monitors for rapid successive requests and other patterns that may indicate abuse.`
