# CENTRALIZED MASTER WORKER ARCHITECTURE
# This project uses a master worker that imports all individual modules.
# Individual modules (calorie.js, event.js, etc.) are NOT standalone workers - 
# they export configuration and prompt generation functions to the master.
#
# DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE:
# 1. Deploy rate limiter first (required dependency):
#    npx wrangler deploy --env ratelimit
#
# 2. Deploy master worker (includes all 10 modules from workers.txt):
#    npx wrangler deploy --env master
#
# The master worker automatically includes all modules listed in workers.txt:
# - calorie/calorie.js, decision/decision.js, enneagram/enneagram.js
# - event/event.js, fashion/fashion.js, income/income.js  
# - philosophy/philosophy.js, quiz/quiz.js, research/research.js, social/social.js
#
# NO individual worker deployments needed - master handles everything!
