Phase 1: Username for Rate Limiting
- Prompt users for a username instead of email for rate limiting/general use.
- Store/check usernames in KV for rate limiting.
- Remove all email references from rate limiting logic/storage.

Phase 2: Payment Form Update
- Update payment form to collect:
  - Email (for payment/receipt)
  - Username (for account/rate limiting/Stripe metadata)
- Replace the name field with a username field.

Phase 3: Stripe Integration
- Add username as metadata when creating Stripe customer/payment (metadata: { username: "user123" }).
- Update backend to include username in Stripe API calls.

Phase 4: Documentation & Testing
- Update documentation to reflect changes.
- Test to confirm usernames are handled correctly in both systems.
