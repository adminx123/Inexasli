Services Accuracy of Results
-----------------------------
- The AI-generated insights, analyses, and outputs provided by the Services are based on large language models and artificial intelligence systems that have inherent limitations, biases, and potential for errors.
- AI systems can produce inaccurate information, misinterpret user input, generate plausible-sounding but incorrect responses (known as "hallucinations"), and may reflect biases present in their training data.
- The Developer aims to provide helpful AI-generated explorations, but these are simplified analyses for learning and exploration purposes only and may not reflect real-world complexities or your specific circumstances. Do not rely on them for important decisions.
- Users should verify all AI-generated insights independently and consult with qualified professionals in relevant fields before making decisions based on any content from the Services.
- Third-Party AI Dependencies: The accuracy and functionality of the Services depend on third-party AI providers whose systems, models, and capabilities may change without notice.
- Bugs and Errors in Calculations:
  - The Developer strives to ensure the functionality of the Services, but bugs, errors, or inaccuracies in calculations, outputs, or generated prompts may occur due to software limitations or unforeseen issues.
  - The Developer shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from bugs or errors in the Services’ calculations, outputs, or prompts, including but not limited to financial losses, missed opportunities, or incorrect data interpretation.
  - Users acknowledge that such errors are inherent risks of using software tools and agree to use the Services at their own risk, relying on professional advice for critical decisions.

Services User Responsibility
-----------------------------
Accuracy of Information
- You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information when using the Services.
- Inaccuracies or omissions may impact the calculations and results.
- Examples of errors include:
  - Duplicate Entries: Entering the same financial data in multiple places on IncomeIQ™.
  - Typographical Errors: Unintentional mistakes from hitting the wrong button.
  - Unit Errors: Attributing an amount to the incorrect field within the specified time frame in IncomeIQ™.
  - Transposition Errors: Unintentional errors where numbers or letters are swapped or reversed.
  - Inaccurate vacation expenses (e.g., travel or lodging costs) in Vacation Worksheet.
  - Incomplete data in Promptemplate™ affecting generated prompts.
- Consult with financial professionals before making any financial decisions.
- For Promptemplate™, users are responsible for the content and sensitivity of data entered, as well as its use in third-party AI systems. The Developer does not monitor, store, or secure data once it is exported from the Services via generated prompts, and users should exercise caution when including personal, confidential, or sensitive information (e.g., health details, financial records) due to potential exposure in external systems.

Appropriate Use
- You agree to use the Services for educational purposes only and in compliance with all applicable laws. Each Service must be used only on its respective page for its intended educational purpose.
- The Services must not be used in a manner that violates laws, infringes on anyone’s rights, or is offensive or harmful.
- Prohibited actions include, but are not limited to:
  - Attempting to reverse engineer or reproduce any part of the Services without consent.
  - Transmitting or uploading any virus or malicious code.
  - Sending spam or unsolicited promotional materials.
  - Collecting or storing personal data about other users inappropriately.
- Users must not misuse Promptemplate™ prompts (e.g., treating generated therapy prompts as substitutes for professional mental health care) in ways that could cause harm to themselves or others. Such misuse is solely the user’s responsibility, and the Developer disclaims any resulting liability.  
- In the event of unauthorized use or any violation of these terms, please notify support@inexasli.com immediately.

Confidentiality
- If you receive any confidential or proprietary information from the Developer or through the Services, you agree to maintain confidentiality and not disclose it to any third party.

Changes in Financial Situation
- As a user, you acknowledge that your financial situation may change over time.
- It is your responsibility to update your information in the Services for accurate results.
- Failure to update may result in inaccurate calculations.

Sensitive Data Warning (Promptemplate™)
- Promptemplate™ generates customized prompts based on user input and copies the resulting prompt template directly to your device’s clipboard for you to paste into third-party AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, or other AI platforms). The Developer does not store, process, or retain any data entered into Promptemplate™—neither on servers, in localStorage, nor in cookies. All data remains transient in your browser’s memory during the generation process and is transferred to your clipboard upon completion.
- You are strongly advised against entering sensitive personal data into Promptemplate™, including but not limited to health information, financial details, or any data subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European Union users (e.g., personal identifiers, racial or ethnic origins, religious beliefs). Once the prompt is copied to your clipboard, it may be temporarily stored in your device’s clipboard memory, which could be accessed by other applications or users on your device if not properly secured. Additionally, if you paste the prompt into a third-party AI system, that data becomes subject to the third-party provider’s privacy practices, terms, and security measures, over which the Developer has no control.
- GDPR Compliance for EU Users: As an EU user, you are responsible for ensuring that any data you input into Promptemplate™ and subsequently paste into third-party AI systems complies with GDPR requirements. Since the Developer does not store or process your data, no GDPR-protected data is retained by INEXASLI. However, you must exercise caution to avoid including GDPR-protected data in prompts, as pasting such data into external AI systems may lead to exposure or breaches under GDPR. By using Promptemplate™, you acknowledge that you assume all risks related to data exposure, including clipboard vulnerabilities and third-party AI system practices, and the Developer is not liable for any GDPR violations resulting from your actions.

Data Security
-------------
Introduction
- By using the Services, you consent to the following practices.
- The Services (IncomeIQ™, Vacation Worksheet, Promptemplate™) operate entirely client-side in your browser. We do not collect, store, or process your data on our servers.
- Data Storage: All data you enter is stored in your browser’s `localStorage`, specific to each Service’s page, and remains on your device in plain text. This data is accessible only by the browser on your device as you use the Services.
- Data Retention: Your data stays in `localStorage` until you clear it or for up to 365 days, whichever comes first, to support continuity in your experience. You control this data through your browser settings.
- Security Measures: As usage data resides in `localStorage` on your device, its security depends on your browser and system. `localStorage` is not encrypted by default, meaning it could be accessed if your device is compromised (e.g., by malware or unauthorized users). We do not add additional security layers beyond standard browser functionality for client-side data. Payment data security is managed by our third-party payment provider, adhering to industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).
- International Users: Since no data leaves your device, local data protection laws (e.g., GDPR for European users) apply to your own management of the data. We provide transparency about this client-side approach.
- Payment Data: When you make a payment (e.g., for premium subscriptions), your payment information is processed securely via a third-party payment provider (Stripe). We do not store your full payment details on our servers; only minimal transactional data (e.g., name, email, transaction ID) is retained as required for billing and support purposes, in compliance with applicable laws.

Rate Limiting and Device Fingerprinting
----------------------------------------
Privacy-Conscious Usage Monitoring
- To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the Services implement privacy-conscious rate limiting using device fingerprinting technology. This system protects the Services while respecting user privacy through minimal data collection.
- Device Fingerprint Generation: A unique identifier is generated based on non-personal browser characteristics including screen resolution, timezone, browser type, and canvas rendering patterns. This fingerprint does not contain personal information and cannot be used to identify you personally.
- Purpose: Device fingerprints are used solely for rate limiting, abuse prevention, and ensuring fair access to AI processing resources. They are not used for tracking, advertising, or any commercial purposes beyond service protection.
- Data Minimization: Only the minimum data necessary for rate limiting is collected. The fingerprint is a mathematical hash that cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal personal information.
- Local Storage: Fingerprint data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage and includes only usage counters and request timestamps. No personal data is included in this local storage.
- Automatic Expiration: Fingerprint data automatically expires after 24 hours, ensuring that usage tracking resets daily for privacy protection.
- No Cross-Service Tracking: Each AI service uses fingerprinting independently without cross-referencing or building profiles across different tools.
- Transparency: Users can inspect the fingerprint data stored in their browser's localStorage under the key "_userFingerprint" to verify no personal information is stored.
- Right to Clear: Users can clear their fingerprint data at any time by clearing their browser's localStorage, though this may reset usage limits.

Centralized Rate Limiting System
- The Services utilize a centralized rate limiting system powered by Cloudflare Workers and KV storage to enforce fair usage limits across all AI modules.
- Per-Module Limits: Different AI tools have different usage limits based on processing complexity and resource requirements (e.g., 2 requests per minute for income analysis, 1 request per minute for personality analysis).
- Suspicious Activity Detection: The system monitors for rapid successive requests and other patterns that may indicate abuse, temporarily restricting access when detected.
- International Processing: Rate limiting data is processed through Cloudflare's global network, which may involve international data transfer of anonymized usage metrics.
- Data Retention: Rate limiting data is retained only as long as necessary for abuse prevention (typically 24-48 hours) before automatic deletion.
- No Personal Profiles: The system tracks usage patterns but does not build personal profiles or store identifying information beyond the anonymized device fingerprint.

Limitation of Liability
