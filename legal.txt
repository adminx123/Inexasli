Services Purpose
-----------------
Educational Tool for Financial Literacy
- IncomeIQ™ is an educational tool designed to help you learn about personal finance through hypothetical scenarios involving income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. It is not for actual tracking or planning.
- Vacation Worksheet is an educational tool to estimate vacation costs based on user-inputted expenses, aiding in travel budgeting understanding.
- Interactive Learning: Users engage with financial concepts by inputting real-life data across the Services, gaining practical understanding of financial principles.
- Visual and Analytical Insights: The Services provide visual representations and analyses of your data, serving as educational aids to demonstrate financial concepts in action.

Personal Record-Keeping
- Track Financial Metrics: IncomeIQ™ allows users to keep a personal record of their financial transactions.
- Helps monitor income and expenses.
- Catalogs assets and liabilities.
- Observes changes in financial status over time.

Facilitation
- Promptemplate™ is a template building tool that allows users input data to generate customized prompts for more efficient and effective input into ai.
- Promptemplate™ generates customized prompts based on user input, intended for use in third-party artificial intelligence (AI) systems (e.g., chatbots, language models). The Developer does not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for the outputs, accuracy, or privacy practices of these external AI systems. By pasting prompts into such systems, users acknowledge that their data leaves the Services’ client-side environment and is subject to the third-party AI provider’s terms, policies, and security measures, over which INEXASLI has no control.

No Professional Advice
- While the Services calculate various metrics or generate outputs (e.g., financial estimates, vacation cost projections, or AI prompts) based on user input, these are for educational purposes only. None of these Services—IncomeIQ™, Vacation Worksheet, or Promptemplate™—provide professional advice, including but not limited to financial, legal, medical, psychological, or therapeutic advice. For example, prompts generated by Promptemplate™ for counseling or therapy purposes are designed to facilitate user exploration within AI systems, not to replace licensed professional guidance.
- Estimates, Not Advice: All figures, outputs, and prompts generated by the Services are estimates or templates and should be viewed as educational examples rather than personalized advice of any kind.
- For Learning, Not Decision-Making: Use these results to understand concepts, experiment with scenarios, or enhance AI interactions. Seek independent advice from qualified professionals for specific financial, health, legal, or personal matters.

Services Accuracy of Results
-----------------------------
- The calculations provided by the Services are educational estimates and are meant to offer a general understanding of financial concepts.
- The Developer aims to provide accurate educational examples, but these are simplified estimates for learning purposes only and may not reflect your real-world financial situation. Do not rely on them for decisions.
- Users should consult with a professional financial advisor, accountant, and/or tax authority for specific financial matters.
- Please note that the frequency selector dropdown for expenses and income in IncomeIQ™ operates on a weekly basis, with 52 weeks constituting a year.
- For Promptemplate™, the accuracy or usefulness of generated prompts depends on the capabilities and limitations of the third-party AI systems into which they are input. The Developer cannot guarantee the quality, relevance, or safety of responses from these external systems, and users should verify AI outputs independently.
- Bugs and Errors in Calculations:
  - The Developer strives to ensure the functionality of the Services, but bugs, errors, or inaccuracies in calculations, outputs, or generated prompts may occur due to software limitations or unforeseen issues.
  - The Developer shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from bugs or errors in the Services’ calculations, outputs, or prompts, including but not limited to financial losses, missed opportunities, or incorrect data interpretation.
  - Users acknowledge that such errors are inherent risks of using software tools and agree to use the Services at their own risk, relying on professional advice for critical decisions.

Services User Responsibility
-----------------------------
Accuracy of Information
- You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information when using the Services.
- Inaccuracies or omissions may impact the calculations and results.
- Examples of errors include:
  - Duplicate Entries: Entering the same financial data in multiple places on IncomeIQ™.
  - Typographical Errors: Unintentional mistakes from hitting the wrong button.
  - Unit Errors: Attributing an amount to the incorrect field within the specified time frame in IncomeIQ™.
  - Transposition Errors: Unintentional errors where numbers or letters are swapped or reversed.
  - Inaccurate vacation expenses (e.g., travel or lodging costs) in Vacation Worksheet.
  - Incomplete data in Promptemplate™ affecting generated prompts.
- Consult with financial professionals before making any financial decisions.
- For Promptemplate™, users are responsible for the content and sensitivity of data entered, as well as its use in third-party AI systems. The Developer does not monitor, store, or secure data once it is exported from the Services via generated prompts, and users should exercise caution when including personal, confidential, or sensitive information (e.g., health details, financial records) due to potential exposure in external systems.

Appropriate Use
- You agree to use the Services for educational purposes only and in compliance with all applicable laws. Each Service must be used only on its respective page for its intended educational purpose.
- The Services must not be used in a manner that violates laws, infringes on anyone’s rights, or is offensive or harmful.
- Prohibited actions include, but are not limited to:
  - Attempting to reverse engineer or reproduce any part of the Services without consent.
  - Transmitting or uploading any virus or malicious code.
  - Sending spam or unsolicited promotional materials.
  - Collecting or storing personal data about other users inappropriately.
- Users must not misuse Promptemplate™ prompts (e.g., treating generated therapy prompts as substitutes for professional mental health care) in ways that could cause harm to themselves or others. Such misuse is solely the user’s responsibility, and the Developer disclaims any resulting liability.  
- In the event of unauthorized use or any violation of these terms, please notify support@inexasli.com immediately.

Confidentiality
- If you receive any confidential or proprietary information from the Developer or through the Services, you agree to maintain confidentiality and not disclose it to any third party.

Changes in Financial Situation
- As a user, you acknowledge that your financial situation may change over time.
- It is your responsibility to update your information in the Services for accurate results.
- Failure to update may result in inaccurate calculations.

Sensitive Data Warning (Promptemplate™)
- Promptemplate™ generates customized prompts based on user input and copies the resulting prompt template directly to your device’s clipboard for you to paste into third-party AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, or other AI platforms). The Developer does not store, process, or retain any data entered into Promptemplate™—neither on servers, in localStorage, nor in cookies. All data remains transient in your browser’s memory during the generation process and is transferred to your clipboard upon completion.
- You are strongly advised against entering sensitive personal data into Promptemplate™, including but not limited to health information, financial details, or any data subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European Union users (e.g., personal identifiers, racial or ethnic origins, religious beliefs). Once the prompt is copied to your clipboard, it may be temporarily stored in your device’s clipboard memory, which could be accessed by other applications or users on your device if not properly secured. Additionally, if you paste the prompt into a third-party AI system, that data becomes subject to the third-party provider’s privacy practices, terms, and security measures, over which the Developer has no control.
- GDPR Compliance for EU Users: As an EU user, you are responsible for ensuring that any data you input into Promptemplate™ and subsequently paste into third-party AI systems complies with GDPR requirements. Since the Developer does not store or process your data, no GDPR-protected data is retained by INEXASLI. However, you must exercise caution to avoid including GDPR-protected data in prompts, as pasting such data into external AI systems may lead to exposure or breaches under GDPR. By using Promptemplate™, you acknowledge that you assume all risks related to data exposure, including clipboard vulnerabilities and third-party AI system practices, and the Developer is not liable for any GDPR violations resulting from your actions.

Data Security
-------------
Introduction
- By using the Services, you consent to the following practices.
- The Services (IncomeIQ™, Vacation Worksheet, Promptemplate™) operate entirely client-side in your browser. We do not collect, store, or process your data on our servers.
- Data Storage: All data you enter is stored in your browser’s `localStorage`, specific to each Service’s page, and remains on your device in plain text. This data is accessible only by the browser on your device as you use the Services.
- Data Retention: Your data stays in `localStorage` until you clear it or for up to 365 days, whichever comes first, to support continuity in your experience. You control this data through your browser settings.
- Security Measures: As usage data resides in `localStorage` on your device, its security depends on your browser and system. `localStorage` is not encrypted by default, meaning it could be accessed if your device is compromised (e.g., by malware or unauthorized users). We do not add additional security layers beyond standard browser functionality for client-side data. Payment data security is managed by our third-party payment provider, adhering to industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).
- International Users: Since no data leaves your device, local data protection laws (e.g., GDPR for European users) apply to your own management of the data. We provide transparency about this client-side approach.
- Payment Data: When you make a payment (e.g., for premium subscriptions), your payment information is processed securely via a third-party payment provider (Stripe). We do not store your full payment details on our servers; only minimal transactional data (e.g., name, email, transaction ID) is retained as required for billing and support purposes, in compliance with applicable laws.


User Responsibilities
- You are responsible for securing your device, as all data stays in `localStorage`. Avoid entering highly sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, passwords) into the Services, as it is stored unencrypted.
- Using private browsing modes or clearing `localStorage` can enhance your privacy.
- Be cautious with data sensitivity to ensure a secure experience.
- For Promptemplate™, the generation of prompts occurs entirely within your browser, and no data is transmitted to our servers or third-party systems during this process. However, once a generated prompt is copied and pasted into a third-party AI system, all data security responsibilities shift to you and the third-party provider. By copying and sharing a prompt, you acknowledge that you assume all associated risks and responsibilities. The Developer strongly recommends avoiding the inclusion of highly sensitive personal information in prompts unless you have reviewed and accepted the privacy policies of the external AI systems you intend to use.

Reporting Concerns
- For questions or concerns about client-side data security, payment processing, or third-party sharing, contact us at support@inexasli.com
